# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Answer: Software engeneering is development and designing of softwares. It is important because it powers the tech we use day to day.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Answer: The genesis of high-level languages, the emergence of structured programing, rise of agile methodologies


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Answer: Planning phase, Designing phase, Implemantation phase


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer: Waterfall is a linear, sequantial approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next phase and is appropriate with projects with well defined and stabele requirements unlikely to change while agile methodologies are incremental approach where project is dived into short cycles and is appropriate with projects with unclear requirements.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Answer: Software developer is responsible for designing, coding, testing and debugging software, while a quality assurance engineer is responsible for ensuring the quality of the software by executing tests to identify defects and ensure the software meets certain criteria while a project manager plans and manages software development project to ensure its complete within stipulated time meeting the needed criteria


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Answer: IDEs provide comprehensive suite of tools within a single app eg VS code while VCS track changes to code over time eg Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Answer: Evolving requirments wich are better addressed by embracing agile methodologies, Tight deadlines which are addressed by managing time effectively


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Answer: Unit testing focuses on testing the smallest testable parts of software app(units) and allows early bug detection, intergration testing verifies that different units of the software work together correctly and helps note interaction issues, system testing evaluates the entire system to ensure it meets specific requirements and validates the requirements while acceptance testing  is done by clients to determine that the system meets their acceptance criteria and signifies user satisfactory.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Answer: Prompt engineering is art of crafting effective inputs for AI models to elicit desired and high quality outputs and its important for it elicits desired outputs and unlocks AI potential


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Answer: Creay art, creat a art of white cat, improving it makes it more clear for the AI to give elicit answer
